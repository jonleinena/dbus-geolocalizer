# DBUS Live - Bus Position Visualizer

A real-time bus position visualizer for DBUS Donostia (San Sebastián, Spain). The app estimates bus positions based on arrival time data from the DBUS website and displays them on an interactive map.

## Features

- 🗺️ Full-screen interactive map (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap)
- 🔍 Search and filter bus lines
- 🔴 Red dot markers showing estimated bus positions
- 📍 Tap a bus to see its route and ETA to each stop
- 🔄 Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- 📱 Mobile-first responsive design

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express
- TypeScript
- xml2js for parsing DBUS data

**Frontend:**
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Leaflet + react-leaflet
- Vite

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd dbus-visualizer
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Running the App

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. In another terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

## How It Works

1. **Data Source**: The app fetches stop data from DBUS's public markers XML files
2. **Arrival Times**: For each stop, it queries the `calcula_parada` AJAX endpoint to get real-time ETAs
3. **Position Estimation**: Bus positions are interpolated based on which stops have the lowest ETAs
4. **Visualization**: Buses appear as red dots; tapping shows the route and ETAs

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/lines` | List all bus lines |
| `GET /api/lines/:lineNum/stops` | Get stops for a line |
| `GET /api/lines/:lineNum/buses` | Get estimated bus positions |
